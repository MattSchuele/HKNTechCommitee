Membership in HKN is extended to the top fifth of the sophomore class, top quarter of the junior class, the top third of the senior class, and all graduate students. Undergraduate students will need to have taken at least 3 ECE courses. Students who meet these requirements will be invited to join HKN at the beginning of the semester. Once invited, initiates will perform a semester of service for HKN before initiating at the end of the semester. See the Initiates Page for more information.
