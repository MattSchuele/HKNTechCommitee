title: Outreach Events
---
Outreach events are focused on teaching fundamental Electrical and Computer Engineering concepts to the surrounding community through applications. Past examples include teaching Boy Scouts circuitry and soldering by creating an optical theremin. We appreciate co-hosting these events with your company representatives and it is a good way to give back to the surrounding community.
In addition, we help companies advertise career opportunities and campus events to our students through fliers, email newsletters, etc. Finally, companies have the opportunity to obtain an electronic copy of the resumes of our active members.
For more information on HKNâ€™s Corporate Committee, sponsoring our society, or hosting an event, recruiters can contact our Corporate Director, Todd Nguyen, at hkn-corporate[at]illinois.edu.
