title: Social Events 
---
Throughout the semester, HKN hosts social events ranging from Mario Kart tournaments to paintball excursions, providing an occasion for employers to interact with students in a more relaxed setting. We also have weekly Happy Hour sessions with IEEE at Legends Bar and Grill from 4-5 PM on Fridays. Some representatives from companies are welcome to join our preplanned events, but they can also organize their own.
