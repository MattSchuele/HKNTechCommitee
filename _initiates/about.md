Be sure to take your selfie during your office hours and share it via the DropBox link in the office! 

Initiate Olympics

There are only three required events for initiates. The first one is Initiate Olympics, which will be held on to be determined. This event is mandatory for all undergraduate initiates and optional for graduate initiates. Pizza will be served. Olympics consists of some fun team building games, and will be a fun time for all.

Member Certificates

Soon, former initiates might come up looking for for their membership certificates during your office hours. Don’t panic. The file-folio that contains them is located in the bottom right-hand drawer of the office hours desk, and is organized by the semester that the initiation occurred. You can locate the specific certificate being requested by name and initiation semester.
