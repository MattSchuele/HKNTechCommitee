IEEE/HKN Happy Hours
---
By far the easiest way to get Social Points for initiation is by attending the weekly IEEE/HKN Happy Hours, held at Legends Bar & Grill on Green Street on Fridays, from 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM. Come meet your officers, fellow initiates, HKN & IEEE Members while eating a free appetizer for every drink you buy! 1 Social Point is awarded for initiate attendance.

Mario Kart Mondays
---
The second easiest way to get Social Points for initiation is by coming to Mario Kart Mondays! Pass by ECEB on Mondays at 5PM for some video games, free pizza, and 1 Social Point. Spring 2015 Mario Kart Mondays will start soon.
