IEEE/HKN Happy Hours
---
By far the easiest way to get Social Points for initiation is by attending the weekly IEEE/HKN Happy Hours, held at Legends Bar & Grill on Green Street on Fridays, from 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM. Come meet your officers, fellow initiates, HKN & IEEE Members while eating a free appetizer for every drink you buy! 1 Social Point is awarded for initiate attendance.

Smash Mondays
---
The second easiest way to get Social Points for initiation is by coming to Smash Mondays! Pass by ECEB 3017 on Mondays at 5PM for some video games, free pizza, and 1 Social Point. Fall 2016 Smash Mondays have started!
