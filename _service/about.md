Review sessions:
---
We provide review sessions before exams for most required ECE courses. We also assist course staff in their review sessions if they need help from HKN. This is also a great chance for our members to get involved and to practice presentation skills in an academic context.

Tutoring:
---
HKN offers free one-on-one peer tutoring. Simply contact a tutor to arrange a time. The tutorâ€™s netid, and the courses for which they are offering tutoring are listed below. If you would like a tutor for a course that is not listed below, please reach out to Corey Snyder at cesnyde2[at]illinois.edu, and we will be happy to arrange something. You can also check the [CARE website](http://publish.illinois.edu/engineering-care/) for tutoring and extra office hours in non-ECE required classes.

After the session, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1NMAgB1nKT2S_UE7yKy4KB6PNFr4cqnBuRoIP3wegFes/viewform). We appreciate your feedback.

Group Tutoring:
---
In addition to normal tutoring, group tutoring brings together students from the same class along with one or many HKN tutors to help moderate and answer questions. These sessions can help to complement your office hours.

Technical Interviews:
---
HKN offers mock technical interviews targeted for students interviewing with ECE companies (software and hardware). Interviews are available either in an interview room with a whiteboard, or over the phone. You will be given questions that accurately reflect the questions given by the company you will be interviewing with, and, where possible, your interviewer will have received an offer from the company as well.

Students interested in becoming interviewers should fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1C0gp2ZXRl4Z8wNi3nlzbg0TUhItu9ivebRvUDyWrjfY/viewform).

Tutorials:
---
HKN runs tutorials throughout the semester to teach students practical skills to help them complete their assignments and give them real-world skills.

Power Lunches
---
Throughout the course of the semester, we arrange lunches with faculty members so that students can get to know them in a more intimate setting.
Stay up to date with HKN events by following our Google Calendar.
