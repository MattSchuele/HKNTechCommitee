title: Dr. Everitt's Neighborhood
---

Purpose
---
Dr. Everitt’s Neighborhood is an independent, student-run guide intended to provide all sorts of useful knowledge about life as an ECE student. Our philosophy is that it is important not to simply repeat the department’s published information, but to supplement it by adding students’ perspectives.

Disclaimer
---
Engineers thrive on the fact that there is always more than one way to do something well. Accordingly, some of thoughts and suggestions expressed in this guide, while respectful, are different from the ones you will hear from the advising office. We encourage you to make your own judgment based on advice from several sources, such as this guide, the advising office, professors, professionals, alumni, friends, and upperclassmen.

In addition, various ECE student organizations offer services that give such advice to students. For example, each semester, IEEE offers a “Gripe Session”, in which IEEE collects student opinions on various courses and communicates these opinions to the ECE department. HKN and the ECE Student Advisory Committee (ECESAC) usually offer peer advising services at the beginning of each semester and around class registration time, respectively.

Getting Involved
---
Dr. Everitt’s Neighborhood is an independent resource written for ECE students, by ECE students; under the oversight of Eta Kappa Nu, the ECE honor society; and with the support, but minimal involvement, of the ECE department.

Ultimately this resource is what you, the fellow ECE student, make of it. It may help you choose courses, research interests, learn more about professors and their personal and professional interests, stay informed on student opinions, etc. Accordingly, this resource lives on the feedback and ideas of the students in ECE. If you can think of other articles or features to include, we want to know, and if you want, you can even help write them.
